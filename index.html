    <h1 style="font-size:20px;"> The life of Charles Babbage </h1>
     <h2 style="font-size:19px;"> By Liam Reid </h2>
      <h3 style="font-size:17px;">History </h3>
      <p>Charles Babbage was born in London England, 1791. He studied at the University of Cambridge. He did not graduate, instead he transfered to Peterhouse college and received a degree without examination. After college, he quickly lectured to the Royal Institution and was elected in 1816. In 1820, Charles greatly influenced the founding the Royal Astronomical Society which originally had a goal of making astronomical calculations more simplified. Babbage helped with this, recalculated and making engines for calculations that could be more widely understood.<br> Charles Babbage died in his home on the 18th of October, 1871</p>
     <h4 style="font-size:17px;">Contributions</h4>
      <p>Charles Babbage made some of the first mechanical computers, including the Difference Engine. The difference engine was used to calculate polynomial functions by calculating different values. Later (1847) he came up with the drawings for a difference engine 2 which would be an improved version of the first one. Sadly it was never built until several decades later when the Science Museum constructed one based on the printings of Babbage. <br>
